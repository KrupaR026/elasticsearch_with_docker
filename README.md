# What is the Docker:

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

Containers are lightweight, standalone executable packages that contain everything an application needs to run, including code, runtime, system tools, and libraries. 

By using containers, developers can ensure that their applications will run consistently across different environments, such as on different operating systems or in different cloud environments. 

This makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications, as well as to scale and manage them in production.
